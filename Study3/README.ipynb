    "We performed a hierarchical clustering to find which regions are similar to each other according to their social relationship representations. For each region, we generated a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) of the 159 relationships, by calculating their Euclidean distance on the 33 conceptual features. We calculated the Spearman correlation between regions’ relationship RDM and then used 1 minus the correlation value, resulting in a region-by-region RDM in which a higher value indicates higher dissimilarity between these two regions based on their social relationship representation. The RDM was first reduced to 2D space using UMAP and then hierarchical clustering was performed using the ‘hclust’ function in R.   "
