# Hierarchical Structure

## Bass-Ackwards Analysis(Forbes, 2023)

We adapted the extended Bass-Ackwards analysis to investigate the hierarchical structure of the FAVEE model (Forbes, 2023). Grateful for Forbes' open-source code on OSF, we utilized functions such as extended_bassAckward and corr_chase_path. After feeding our data into the core function, we conducted parallel analysis and streamlined the results by plotting loadings across various levels.

## EFA & CFA

We averaged the data from 15 regions as the "global data", and each area as the "areas data", in this code, we tried exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis on the "global data". In the second part, we showed factor loadings of different areas. 

## Word Cloud

We displayed the wordclouds using the data of the results of the Bass-Ackwards analysis. The font size is represented the loadings of each evaluative feature.
