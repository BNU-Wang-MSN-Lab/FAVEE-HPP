            In complementary to the PCA, we used a series of dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., ICA, EFA, MDS, and network analysis) corresponding to figure a-c, e, and also found the five prominent dimensions (i.e., FAVEE). Figure d showed that FAVEE model seems to be very stable and generalizable across analytical techniques.

            Further, by using model comparison methods, we foundÂ FAVEE model substantially outperformed other 15 existing theories.
