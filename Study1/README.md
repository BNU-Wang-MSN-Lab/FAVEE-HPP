In study1, we recruited 817 participants in USA via MTurk. The codes of cleaning data and PCA are shown in __DataCleanPCA.ipynb.__  

In addition to PCA, we conducted independent component analysis (ICA), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and multidimensional scaling (MDS) in order to assess the robustness of the results, which are shown in __ValidationFAVEE.ipynb__.
