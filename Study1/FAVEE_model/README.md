In study1, we recruited 817 participants in USA via MTurk. The codes of cleaning data and PCA are shown in __DataCleanPCA.ipynb.__  

In addition to PCA, we conducted independent component analysis (ICA), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), multidimensional scaling (MDS) and network analysis in order to assess the robustness of the results, which are shown in __ValidationFAVEE.ipynb and Network_analysis.ipynb__ .
