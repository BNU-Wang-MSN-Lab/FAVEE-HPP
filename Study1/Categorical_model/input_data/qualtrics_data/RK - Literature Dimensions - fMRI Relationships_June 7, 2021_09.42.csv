Definition: People in a ‘Communal’ relationship willingly share resources (time, food, space) with each other. Benefits are given in support of the partner's welfare non-contingently; that is, benefits are given without the donor or the recipient feeling the recipient has an obligation to repay. In contrast, people in ‘Exchange’ relationship do not share resources for free. They have to follow some exchange rules—a benefit comes with a price tag and payback (e.g. money, time, service, resource).
