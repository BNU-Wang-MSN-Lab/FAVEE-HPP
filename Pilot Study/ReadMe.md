To establish a design with adequate statistical power, a pilot study was conducted (n=721, recruited from MTurk) using the dimensional survey from Wish et al. (1976).

We ran a Monte Carlo simulation test to derive the minimally required responses in each condition to maintain a stable and consistent PCA result. PCA was performed on each subsample (from 2 to 40, with 1000 iterations for each subsample), and loading scores and relationship scores were compared with the overall dataset using Pearsonâ€™s correlation.

The simulation results indicated that subsamples with 10 responses were almost identical to the entire dataset (rating correlation r > 0.95) and thus should be adequate to ensure highly similar derived PCA components (loading score correlation r > 0.90; relationship score correlation r > 0.95).
